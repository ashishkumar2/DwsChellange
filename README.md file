Welcome to the Transfer Service project!!

- Enhance error handling by providing meaningful error messages and HTTP status codes in API responses.

- Implement a global exception handler to centralize error handling logic.

- Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, especially if this service exposes sensitive financial transactions.

- Wrap database operations in transactions to ensure data consistency during transfers.

- Choose a production-ready deployment strategy, such as containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes.

- Document the API using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI.

- Implement load balancing.

- Set up automated CI/CD pipelines to streamline testing, deployment, and release processes.
